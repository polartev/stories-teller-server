# Stories-Teller Server  

This repository contains the **server-side core** of the **Stories-Teller** project.  
The server coordinates interactions between **clients** and the **generator app**, managing task distribution and data exchange.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Accepts connections from **clients** via WebSocket (`/ws/client`).  
- Accepts connections from the **generator app** via WebSocket (`/ws/admin`).  
- Receives generation requests from clients via HTTPS (`/upload`).  
- Notifies the generator app about new tasks in real time.  
- Provides endpoints for the generator to upload/download files (`/uploads/{filename}`, `/descriptions/{filename}`).  
- Collects generated results from the generator (`/describe`) and makes them available to clients.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **WebSocket** â€“ communication with clients and the generator
- **HTTPS** â€“ handling uploads, results, and file access
- **FastAPI** - endpoints, structure, and layout
- **Pydantic** â€“ data validation and secure message models
